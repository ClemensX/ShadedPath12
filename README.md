# ShadedPath12
DirectX 12 Framework and Applications

For the time being, this repo will be used to port my DX11/Oculus framework to DX12. Until it has at least limited public use the version will stay on 0.0.

Most development is done in C++ and uses VisualStudio 2015 Community with Win 10 SDK.
Target Platform is Windows 10 (64 bit only).
Some tools are Java based and use eclipse 4. This is mostly done for tools used in asset handling.

# Versions
0.0 - port / test / implement DX12 features. Expect drastic changes at any time. Will have very limited use to look at and may not even compile.
